## ⚙️ How It Works

When you visit Instagram, InstaBlocker springs into action:

1. **🕒 CHECK:** Is there a valid 10-minute timestamp in LocalStorage?
* **YES:** Allow access.
* **NO:** Deploy The Wall.


2. **🔒 BLOCK:** A full-page overlay covers the content.
3. **❓ QUIZ:** The script picks a random question (e.g., "What is FIFO?").
4. **⌨️ INPUT:** User types the answer.
5. **✅ SUCCESS:**
* Overlay is removed.
* Timestamp is saved for 10 minutes.
* User is free to scroll.
